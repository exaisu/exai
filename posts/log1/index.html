        <h2>Sunday, 05/07/2022</h2>
            <p>This is the first log entry on my site. hello! unsure how many people would be interested in reading this. I know <a href="https://twitter.com/dictatemusic/status/1523076758110879745">Dictate said he was interested</a>, so shoutout to him!</p>
            <p>i've been wanting to make this site a reality for around six months, but i'm glad i finally got around to it. Additionally, this coincides with my ability to get out and do more stuff. buying new clothes and whatnot, and finally being interested in "my look" i guess. no more anime-centric clothing (although in Little Tokyo I almost bought a miku denim jacket. we dont talk about that)</p>
            <p>Speaking of Little Tokyo, it was on Friday that I went with <a href="https://twitter.com/joshisadong">@joshisadong</a>. I'm actually so impressed by the area, that I think I like it more than Downtown LA- but that isn't saying a lot. we actually overheard someone going on a race rant to themselves as they walked by us downtown, so case in point. Before we ended up in Little Tokyo though, we decided to go to Amoeba Music (obligarory). Initially I grabbed a few CDs, but I straight up put them back because I was planning on buying a new stereo unit for my car, rendering any CDs I buy useless! I ended up in the electronic vinyl section, where Autechre represses finally started accumulating- I picked up Amber and LP5, which I spent a few months hunting down between there and a local record store- fucking finally.</p>
            <p>after we left, Josh and I went to Iguana, a vintage clothing shop which was legit next door to Amoeba. It was okay, but slightly overpriced, but I'm willing to excuse it because their inventory was quite massive. I'd recommend it for looking around in the downtown LA area, but all I picked up was a belt because I needed one- Josh bought a varsity jacket and we were out.</p>
            <p>I grabbed a cup of black coffee from a place next door, and we ended up driving to Little Tokyo.</p>
            <p>as one would do in a district filled with anime related stores, we went to every single one of them. and bought absolutely nothing. we also went to a manga/bookstore around the corner, which had a punk t-shirts book that was marked up. So I did what most reasonable people would do, which was to buy it on amazon instead. we left, once again (technically) empty handed. nearby was a japanese market, and I bought some mr. brown vanilla coffee (actually pretty damn good), and that was that. right outside was a specialized matcha ice cream shop, which naturally caught our attention, so indulge we did- in the best ice cream I've possibly ever had.</p>
            <p>a bit of a walk, and we came across clothing shops such as popkiller, where I ended up buying a coogi jacket.. worth it though. after all, I do intend on building my clothing syle.</p>
            <p>a shit ton of stores later, we ended up driving back to orange county, and grabbed chilis for dinner.</p>
            <p>after, we went to see Everything Everywhere All at Once in theaters- pretty good movie (which didn't surprise me given it was produced by A24).</p>
            <p>This was all in one day, but it's funny because it's the only substantial thing I'd done all week. I would not be surprised if future entries become much shorter, but I do intend on writing up one of these per week.</p>
