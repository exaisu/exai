        <h2>Saturday, 07/09/2022</h2>
            <p>i promise i didn't forget about this LOL</p>
            <p>a lot of things have been going on this past month+ or so, I feel like I could go into sensory overload.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1532286820888612864">(06/02/22)</a> I had a midnight denny's dinner with my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/joshisadong">@joshisadong</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudychelc">@cloudychelc</a>, pretty fun. it's something I wish I could do more with them or with friends in general, but it was a partial parting gift; they had to travel back home for the summer.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1533690612918018049">(06/05/22)</a> a few days later i went to universal with chelsea, which was fun. on the stance of amusement parks, it was a bit tame (im a massive thrill ride nut), but not enough to where it hindered any sense of enjoyment. even just walking around the park was a refresher. aside from that, not much else to say.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1538052050138714112">(06/17/22)</a> things sat in purgatory for a bit, to say the least. on the bright side I got my keyboard on the 17th and started a fucking 3 day switch lubing process which could only be described as painful.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1538779050889490432">(06/20/22)</a> finished the board on the 20th, im really fucking impressed by this thing. it outdoes my RAMA KARA in every aspect, even the price. paying $120 for a custom build like this is near impossible, and my KARA cost me $300 in total. I also highly recommend these clone keycaps. GMK btfo, no way in hell is 1y8mo of a lead time sane- on top of that, i'm not interested in spending $130+ on keycaps (more than this board's raw total cost). also, typing test <a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1539122115223461888">here!</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1540245394478596096">(06/24/22)</a> went north about an hour and a half, to see my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/Xen0h">@Xen0h</a> in LA. I so happen to be 10 minutes from a microcenter, so I bought him a Lian Li O11 Dynamic case to build when I arrived. needless to say, I'm massively impressed and even tempted to case swap my 4000D for one of these. insanely fucking jealous, all i gotta say. after that we just hung out and decided to chill for the night. i did errands with him the day after, watched sonic 2, and before I left for home we went on a short hike and talked about a bunch of things to improve motivation. when we walked back, him and I talked about content creation- something I used to be incredibly fond of, and lots of people are familiar with that. I talked with him about an idea I've only considered to myself really, which was to make a return to form of sorts. I used to own a pretty memorable hypixel channel which revolved around BSG/blitz content- it's no secret, I have brought it up lots of times to friends, and people have followed me into the osu! community through these means. I had a lot of fantastic ideas to bring me back to the surface, this time with a much healthier mindset. In fact, most things would change than remain the same. The idea of making longer and higher quality content (30-40 minutes long) has started to intrigue me as I have ideas that would stretch that long. It made me excited to think about.</p>
            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/exaiosu/status/1542412148512436224">(06/30/22)</a> I found out about "The Aidenification of Technotwt". even more absurd than that sentence I've just typed out, is the fact that I trended in January because of Technoblade's fandom. Adding onto that
            stub from before- I used to be friends with the man. I share a lot of fond memories with him, as he was one of my first Hypixel friends, which is also to say he was one of my oldest online friends too. It blew my mind, figuring out that this stemmed from an interaction I had on his first big break of many- his Hypixel YT rank video. I shared my gratitude and message of congratulation to his comment section. His reply? "ty babe". It was a silly joke then, only to explode SIX YEARS LATER. the most insane part of this is the fact that I had zero clue about any of this. I legit found this out from nonchalantly searching my name + techno on a discord bot out of curiosity. That's all it took. I went through thread after thread, jaw on floor and shit. it was so beyond me I had no idea how to react.</p>
            <h4>18 hours later, the news of techno's passing went public</h4>
            <p>I could not be more upset by the timing of these circumstances. I thought I had a chance to reach back out and reunite with him. I don't want to sugarcoat it but I felt happy knowing that he liked a tweet about the "Aidenification" situation, in the form of fanart. I haven't talked to him since 2017, but he remained someone fate simply slipped by with. is that to say these memories I've cherished didn't happen? nah. I'm not too hung up about it at this point, but he remained one of the only real people I've experienced in the youtube space. lots of these people won't look at you the same way after they've had a taste of B-list celebrity tier fame, especially in the mc space. but that just wasn't him. techno was always such a down to earth guy who i'd spent one 2014 night playing worms with until 3am. often i would sit in teamspeak/skype with him, hours after we'd finished recording a BSG video together and just talk about whatever. none of this mentions the dm conversations i had with him, which were always beyond humorous- he always had such an absurdist sense of humor you can't help but imagine where it came from. when the news of his initial cancer diagnosis made waves in september, the only way i could react was by panicking to get back in contact with him. my stature was: whatever the cost, I'd want to get back in contact. because I simply had no clue what I'd do if I didn't. fast forward to now, my panicking only resulted in leads I never ended up taking. I had some connections I didn't realize I had until it was simply too late. in a way, i'm okay with the way things ended up, because him and I spent our time together and I will never forget any of it. I'm glad I met such a wonderful individual and I'm glad he could go out with such a bang. ten million people is a lot, and it's a pretty big reminder that death doesn't discriminate. cancer doesn't discriminate. these things befall upon someone regardless. seeing the support for him among everyone online reminds me that nearly everyone views him with a similar level of admiration. and I'm proud. miss you man. ur comboing me even from the grave here but I have zero complaints. rest easy. in light of this, i've made all my old videos with techno public again (https://www.youtube.com/user/aidenrk). as for my upload ideas, they will go to a new channel, seeing as I no longer feel comfortable uploading them here, i'll announce that sometime- who knows. felt like it was the right thing to do.</p>
            <p>soon, I have an Anime North trip coming up. I've been looking forward to this for 3 years since COVID shut down any hopes of the last two. spending time with friends in toronto should bring my hopes up. seeing as I can't wait is a good sign. I may post another update before I leave. if not, then after. seeing as I've already fucked up the weekly blogpost hustle I don't see it mattering too much.</p>
            <p>also planning on setting up a proper theming for my site. the plaintext html hype has worn off a bit.</p>
