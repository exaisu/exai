        <h2>Sunday, 5/22/2022</h2>
            <p>Hey! It's been a while since I last posted here. I said I'd like to post here every week or so, but time got ahead of me and here I am two weeks later.</p>
            <p>The fact that I even have my site up is a miracle in itself, so naturally I kinda decided to sit on things for a bit. But lately, things have been kind of slow so this is fine anyway. I've been on a Bedwars and SDVX bender since I last updated. With Bedwars, I've been playing a lot of the challenges in 4v4v4v4. For reference, <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/guide-tips-how-to-complete-all-the-bedwars-challenges-with-ease.4605428/">here</a> is a link containing each Bedwars challenge. Considering the fact that I've played this game for a very long time, it's incredibly refreshing to pick the game back up in a new way.</p>
            <p>I recently went to Round One with my friends Josh and Chelsea, and picked up an e-amusement pass, which allows for online tracking of Bemani games. Sadly, I didn't know that they were pretty much useless for Sound Voltex in the US. Paseli, the currency most recommended for SDVX credits, is illegal here, meaning Round One has it disabled. The main mode best for play is also illegal here due to COPPA laws for online tracking/submission(?) So as a result, the only playable mode is Light Start. It allows 3 songs per credit and I believe each credit is 8 points at R1, which ends up being $2 per credit, which turns out to be very expensive considering every failed chart wastes the rest of the credit. I had to find this out the hard way sadly.</p>
            <p>I had a fun meetup planned over the weekend which I sadly had to pass by due to COVID concerns, but I've been testing negative over the past few days, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. I have been feeling very liberated with my ability to hang out with friends often, a luxury I didn't believe to be as valuable as it is. Over the years, confiding in online discourse has grown more and more dull with time, and so have games with other people. This naturally results in games not feeling "fun" anymore, or at least without specific groups of people. Instead, I've felt like I yearn for the opportunity to sit and have long conversations with people, so gaming has been in a weird place for me I guess? I know others that feel the same way too. I wouldn't be too surprised if this feeling was accelerated due to COVID/lockdown.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I'm also waiting on a <a href="https://www.keebmonkey.com/products/ciy-gas67-gasket-keyboard-kit?variant=42644421542103">GAS67</a>, which has been described to me as a fantastic budget board. The only other keyboard build I own is a RAMA KARA which has been doing me okay, and while the 55%/HHKB layout has grown on me, it has an 8 degree slant and absensce of arrow keys can be annoying sometimes. I ordered my GAS67 with GMK clones and KTT Matcha switches, and I'll definitely be sure to post here about it in future entries. Not looking forward to lubing these switches and stabs however, because my last venture in lubing switches was with my Gateron ink blacks. They took me like 4-5 days to complete, and tuning stabs is fucking annoying. the Holee mod sucks due to the precision required, but I would definitely recommend the medical tape mod over Holee any day. Basically, it just involves wrapping your stabilizer wire thinly with medical tape.</p>
            <p>Bit of a boring one this time, but I'm wanting to do more with my site. I might want to even spice things up a bit and set everything up with my preferred color scheme, that being "PLASMA", which I use in my latest mc pvp pack. Speaking of, I've also added links to all the packs I've made over the years. Some of the earlier ones suck, but <a href="https://www.exai.pw/packs/">check it out!</a> </p>
